# homework-1-code-refactor
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

In this homework activity I took div classes that were under titles such as <div> header </div> and changed these div's to their html symantic elements (<header> </header>). I also removed id's where there were already a duplicated version within a class. All of these refactor techniques were used based on the resources I gathered from W3school.com. 

Update 12/29/20: 

- Changed the <title> tag to be descriptive to the project. 
- added alt tags on each image
- updated the css with comments
